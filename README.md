This site was created like a game sales site or something like that. The project took a little over a week, including the development of the layout.
From future updates:
   1 - Filtering of game cards by search with their relevant location will be added.
   2 - Perhaps the adaptive design system will be slightly improved, although the adaptation was completed successfully and this project is not “mobile-first”.
   3 - A system of modal windows will be added to interact with the main content. The modal window will have a description of the product card (game).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

### `npm run build` fails to minify
